Our idea was to take a handdrawn image and use a machine learning algorithm to analyze the sentiment or content of the picture, and then create a playlist for you of songs based on the picture. For example, a baseball bat plays baseball songs, and a smiley face would play happy songs. Currently, the image classifier works, and we have an algorithm for generating words that have the same connotation as a given word, as well as an algorithm that analyzes the sentiment of a given songs lyrics.
